# Do not use Scrum

## Context
Scrums sprint cycles are normally centered around the release cadence of a product. Modern teams must have a fully automated release pipeline that allows for code that has been peer reviewed and pushed upstream, to make its way into production within minutes. Such release pipelines do not require a release cadence.

Scrum rituals take up a significant amount of time and for the most part are compensating for bad communication within teams. Developers should not require a set time window during which they can raise issues (standup) - they should have the support available to them to resolve issues as soon as they arise. Retrospectives should not be restricted to once per sprint cycle - team members should discuss what's going well and what's going wrong throughout their workweek, as they feel like it. By enforcing these time-boxed rituals, individuals tend to feel like they must contribute something, even when they have nothing to contribute, which leads to fruitless, forced discussions that feel like a waste of time, causing frustration within a team.

Work complexity estimation, which is not part of Scrum but is almost universally coupled to it, takes 5-10 sprints working on an established project to achieve its goal of figuring out a teams capacity. Depending on sprint cadence, this can be too long for most teams and projects, as most projects tend to not stay under active development for that long. Team members leaving in the middle of a project can have huge negative impact on the project. Because of this, it is almost universally understood among developers that estimates in most teams are wildly inaccurate, always resulting in failed sprints.

Due to the overhead of managing Scrum driven projects, the process requires a good project manager to manage it. Unfortunately, good project managers are in short supply and as one is required for each team to run the process fruitfully, the cost to run Scrum in your teams properly, tends to be prohibitively expensive.

Scrum requires a skilled team to be fruitful. It is not very friendly to less experienced developers, and can therefore lead to underachieving teams if that is not taken into account during recruitment. If it is taken into account during recruitment, it decreases the size of the candidate pool.

Scrum helps teams focus on delivering as much as they can in a given sprint, and avoids scope creep by locking in what work will be done during a given sprint.

## Decision
We will not use Scrum.

## Consequences
A way to communicate the complexity of work to the business is required, to ensure that any given piece of work that costs more than the business has appetite for, is brought back to the drawing board. This may require a separate decision record.

Developers, as well as being interrupted less, have more time available to them to do work than they would under Scrum.

A teams work can be managed by the team lead without them getting overburdened by process.

Robust communication ethic must be established within a team to ensure team members have all the help they need, and things like scope creep and useless work are kept at bay.

Backlog has to be refined continuously.
