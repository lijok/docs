# Use ISO 8601

## Context
There are many date and time format standards, and they are all in contention.

We should use a standardized, culture-neutral date and time format, that is widely accepted in the industry and supported by majority of the tools.

## Decision
We will use [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format to represent date and time.

We will store and transmit time in ISO 8601 format.

We will heavily prefer ISO 8601 over Unix time when possible.

## Consequences
Date and time formats are consistent between projects.

Developers and API consumers can make an assumption about date and time formats, lowering cognitive load.

Tools and 3rd party software that do not support ISO 8601 will create inconsistencies and may hinder adoption.

Date and time is human-readable in API responses.
