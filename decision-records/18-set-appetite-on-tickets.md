# Set appetite on tickets

## Context
Business is rarely interested in an exact estimate of how long a certain piece of work will take to deliver. Business is usually more concerned with a certain piece of work not taking longer to complete than it has appetite for.

A way for the business to communicate appetite for a piece of work is required,to ensure that any given piece of work that costs more than the business has appetite for, is brought back to the drawing board.

## Decision
We will set an appetite, on all tickets, counted in man-days.

We will communicate back to the business any work that exceeds the set appetite, so it can be descoped, split out into smaller pieces of work or rethought.

## Consequences
Work can be prioritised by its ROI (how much appetite there is versus how long it will take).

Man-days, which is a very inaccurate metric when used as an estimate, due to all engineers having varying skill levels on different topics, can be utilized well as a means to distribute work when used to express appetite. Team members among themselves may decide who is most capable of delivering a piece of work within a given time frame, allowing work to be better distributed. Using this method, more junior developers also get to partake in more complex pieces of work, if those pieces of work have a high enough ROI due to high appetite.

Work on a ticket can be abruptly stopped as soon as it is concluded that it will take longer than there is appetite for, allowing for agile course correction to take place.
