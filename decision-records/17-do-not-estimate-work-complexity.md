# Do not estimate work complexity

## Context
In practice, estimating work complexity of small pieces of work is always wildly inaccurate, usually underestimated, in engineering teams. This is due to lack of context, team members coming in and out, projects not living long enough to have older work to reference, etc.

Estimating work complexity in a remote-first environment, requires additional tooling if done as a team exercise (i.e. online planning poker), complicating an already complicated process.

Business is rarely interested in an exact estimate of how long a certain piece of work will take to deliver. Business is usually more concerned with a certain piece of work not taking longer to complete than it has appetite for.

## Decision
We will not estimate work complexity.

## Consequences
A way for the business to communicate appetite for a piece of work is required,to ensure that any given piece of work that costs more than the business has appetite for, is brought back to the drawing board. This may require a separate decision record.
