# Use RFC 3339

## Context
There are many date and time format standards, and they are all in contention.

We should use a standardized, culture-neutral date and time format, that is widely accepted in the industry and supported by majority of the tools.

To ensure consistency, and reduce bugs, we must use a date and time format that is consistent, and has no variation between implementations.

## Decision
We will use [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format as our basis to represent date and time.

We will store and transmit time in RFC 3339 format.

We will use a space as a Date and Time separator instead of `T`, i.e. `2020-09-01 12:55:00+00:00` instead of `2020-09-01T12:55:00+00:00`.

Where available, we will include fraction seconds, i.e. `2020-09-01 12:55:33.889010+00:00`

We will always include the timezone offset (e.g. `+00:00` for UTC), when a time component is present.

We will heavily prefer ISO 3339 over Unix time when possible.

## Consequences
Date and time formats are consistent between projects.

Developers and API consumers can make an assumption about date and time formats, lowering cognitive load.

Tools and 3rd party software that do not support RFC 3339 will create inconsistencies and may hinder adoption.

Date and time is human-readable in API responses.
